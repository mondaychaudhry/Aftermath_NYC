            <p>If you are concerned about sexually transmitted infections or pregnancy, the good news is- if you go the emergency room right away, there's a solid chance these will not be an issue. If you are concerned about HIV, HIV PEP should be taken within 72 hours of potential HIV transmission. The sooner it is taken, the more effective it will be. Emergency contraception should also be taken within 72 hours, but can be taken up to 120 hours (efficacy does drop significantly).</p>

            <h3>The Cycle of Abuse & Saftey Planning</h3>
            <p>Some signs of domestic abuse can be more subtle than others, which can make it difficult for you to determine if you are in a dangerous situation or not.  Many people are not aware that they are in abusive relationships for a variety of reasons. However, domestic violence is about power and control, and even seemingly small signs can point to a much larger issue. A social worker at the SAFE hospitals will best be able to assess your case and determine a solution that allows you to safely leave a dangerous situation. This diagram demonstrates some of the basic tenets of abusive relationships. </p>
            <img className='img' src='https://www.wavi.org/assets/images/uploads/powercontrolchart-you.png' />

            <p>Safety planning is an incredibly helpful tool when planning ahead regardless of what stage of relationship you may be in. If you are in a relationship that you are unable to leave right away, please use the following questions to guide your safety moving forward during  incidents. Do you have a trusted neighbor who has been informed to call the police if they hear noises coming from your home? If you have children, do they know how to call the police (ensure they are aware of your address and phone number)? If you expect an argument, do you have a space where there is easy access to a door or other exit? Do you have codeword to use with children, friends, family, or neighbors when you need the police called? A codeword that means "we are going to go" or "we are coming"? Do you have a packed bag in a safe place (friend's house) in order to leave quickly? Remember, leaving an abusive situation is the most dangerous time. It may be helpful to remind yourself daily of your strength and resilience. You do not deserve to be hurt or threatened.</p>
