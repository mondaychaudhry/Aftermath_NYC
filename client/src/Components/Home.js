                AFTERMATH NYC is a crisis management tool designed to assist survivors of physical and sexual assault in New York City by providing information and local resources to help you make the best and most informed choices. The application includes medical and legal information related to physical and sexual assault. There is a community section where members and organizations local to NYC offer free or discounted services that may help survivors in some way. Additionally there is a notes section in the user home to record any notes you may not want stored anywhere else on your device. 

                Please remember that what happened to you is NOT your fault and you are in NO way responsible. Somebody else made a choice to hurt you, which is NEVER okay. What you are feeling right now is normal. Some people might have a hard time understanding what youâ€™ve been through and might try to influence your decisions. But, you know what is best for you. You deserve as much time as you need- take it five minutes at a time if you have to.
                You have choices.
                You have rights.
                You deserve to feel safe.
                You are not alone.
