            <p>We are here to support you during this difficult time. You may be feeling very overwhelmed and that's totally okay! The aftermath app is a crisis management tool designed for survivors of physical and sexual assault in New York City. The app offers a brief overview of some legal information and medical information that may be of interest. The healing process will take time. NYC has a very large and diverse community to help with this process. We have created a community resources platform that allows local organizations and community members  to offer a variety of kindnesses and services, specifically for survivors. Feel free to browse this section and contact them directly. Lastly, in case there are any notes you would like to take that you do not feel comfortable leaving anywhere else on your device, please feel free to complete entries directly in the app.</p>

            <p>What happened to you is in no way your fault and is a crime</p>

            <p>You are not alone</p>
            <p>We believe you </p>
            <p> There is a whole community here to help you heal</p>

            <p>If you are lost on what to do next, find a safe space. Whether that's a room in your house or a public bench or a park. Now let's try to come up with a list of priorities on what to do next. Are you concerned about your health? Do you want to file a police report? Do you need someone to talk to? If the answer to any of these was yes, it may be a good idea to go to the emergency room of a local hospital. Many ERs have dedicated programs for survivors comprised of healthcare professionals and social workers.</p>
